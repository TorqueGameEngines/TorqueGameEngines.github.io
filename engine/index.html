                Frozen Cortex is the premier tactical future sports game! 
                It combines the strategic depth of Frozen Synapse with completely
                original creative gameplay and a thrilling futuristic aesthetic. 
                You must design a play to get the ball into your opponent's endzone,
                using the stadium's procedurally-generated terrain to your advantage.

                Well, if you want a hardcore, heavy metal roleplaying experience
                that challenges you, this is the ticket. Otherwise, take a pass.
                The game is vicious, both in its lack of morality and its
                merciless systems. If you want to be the hero of a story, run
                and donâ€™t look back. If you want to be Atia of the Julii or be
                a power player, this is your RPG.

            <p>
            Torque 3D includes both a high-performance forward-rendering basic
            lighting engine, and a deferred-rendering advanced lighting mode so
            you can tailor your game to meet the needs of different customers.
            The modern rendering system includes per-pixel lighting, normal and
            parallax mapping, and materials generated by a high-level editor, or
            written from scratch in GLSL/HLSL. The engine comes with shaders
            for water, sky and sun, and many common material types.
            </p>
            <p>
            The engine also has a powerful PostFX system allowing you to create

            <p>
            Since its inception as the engine behind the online shooter Tribes 2,
            Torque has consistently provided high performance, reliable networking
            for fast-paced online games. The engine has networking built into 
            its core, allowing you to quickly get up and running with networked
            games.
            </p>
            <p>
            Torque uses a <em>server authoritative</em> networking model that
            helps you to reduce cheating and exploitation. At the same time,
            the game state is predicted and interpolated locally so each client
            experiences a smooth view of the action. Time-invarying data is
            transferred via datablocks at client join time, reducing the amount
            of data that needs to be networked during gameplay.

            If you're not the recompiling type, Torque provides a scripting engine
            using a custom C-like language called TorqueScript. You can create
            whole games without touching a line of C++. Check this out:

   datablock = MinionData;
};
$minion.name = "Fubar";
$minion.setMoveDestination("50 0 0");

function Fubar::onReachDestination(%self) {
   echo("I made it! Says" SPC %self.name);

        Please note that the roadmap is currently being debated by the Steering Committee.
        This version represents our rough ideas and intentions and may change when we
        settle on an actual plan! When that happens we will document future engine
        versions here with their planned outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3>Short-term</h3>
    <p>
    The theme of our immediate efforts will be cleaning up the state of the repository,
    forging new links with the community, and putting in place procedures that will
    make the Committee more effective in the future.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Complete and launch this website!</li>
        <li>Set up automated testing to increase ease of maintenance.</li>
        <li>Merge (possibly into unstable branches) or reject all outstanding pull-requests.
        In particular:
        <ul>
            <li>A usable CMake alternative to the current Project Generator</li>
            <li>64-bit-ready changes</li>
            <li>VS2013 compatibility</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Middle-term</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Linux and OSX support via OpenGL rendering layer.</li>
        <li>DirectX 11 and PhysX 3.3 support.
        <li>New modular script templates and content distribution.</li>
        <li>More difficult existing pull-requests, particularly improvements to the TorqueScript language.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Long-term</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Clean up engine source code (e.g. use of non-STL container replacements, signed/unsigned mismatches).</li>
        <li>Modularise scripting engine, paving the way for other scripting languages.</li>
        <li>Entity/component system replacing hardcoded gameplay classes.</li>
        <li>Overhaul editor suite</li>
    </ul>
